# Development Process

**Step-by-step how I built it:**

1. Created the project folder and initialized Git
2. Wrote the main calculator loop using `while True`
3. Used `input().split()` to separate number → operator → number
4. Added `try-except` to catch invalid numbers
5. Created separate checks for each operator (+ - * /)
6. Added special check for division by zero
7. Added clear error messages and 'quit' option
8. Tested many times in VS Code terminal
9. Made multiple meaningful Git commits
10. Added README.md and screenshots
11. Created this docs folder

Tools used: Visual Studio Code, Git, GitHub
