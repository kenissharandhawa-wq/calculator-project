# Future Improvements

Ideas to make it even better later:
- Add a graphical user interface (GUI) using Tkinter or PyQt
- Add more operations: square root, percentage, power (^)
- Save calculation history to a file
- Make it a web calculator using HTML/CSS/JavaScript
- Add scientific mode (sin, cos, log, etc.)
- Support keyboard arrows to edit previous input
